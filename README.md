# Data_Science_And_Statistics


This repository documents my **Data Science learning journey**, showcasing projects, exercises, and notebooks that demonstrate practical skills in Python, data analysis, and foundational data science techniques.  

It will continue to grow as I add more projects, datasets, and experiments over time.

##  Current Highlight: Efficient Data Acquisition with Pandas

This notebook demonstrates **the first critical step in Data Science: acquiring and understanding data**. Key concepts covered include:

- **Streamlined Data Ingestion:** Load datasets from CSV, Excel, JSON, and other formats  
- **Quick Data Assessment:** Inspect datasets with `.head()`, `.shape`, `.describe()`  
- **Building a Strong Foundation:** Create workflows for clean, reliable data ready for analysis  

The principle is simple: **clean data in â†’ quality insights out**.
